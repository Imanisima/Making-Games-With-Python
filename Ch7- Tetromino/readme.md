A Tetric clone.

Differently shaped blocks (each made up of four boxes) fall from the top of screen where they must be guided down to complete rows that have no gaps in them. If there is no gap in the row, the row disappears and each row above it moves down a row.

The player fails when the screen fills up and a new falling block cannot fit.
