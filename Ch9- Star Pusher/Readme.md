Star Pusher is a "Box Pusher" clone. The player is in a room with several stars. There are star marks on the ground of some of the tile sprites in the room. The player must figure out how to push the stars on top of the tiles with star marks.
Note that the player cannot push a star if there is a wall or another star behind it.
Note that the player cannot pull stars, so if the star ends up in a corner they will have to restart.
When all the stars have been successfully pushed onto star-marked tiles, the level is complete and another begins.
